"""Render a TMF8829 depth frame in a terminal.

A depth grid is an image, and printing it as a table of numbers throws away
the thing that makes it useful: you cannot see a shape in a table of numbers.
These renderers aim at the opposite, so that a person watching a live sensor
can tell at a glance what is in front of it.

Three ideas do most of the work.

**Two zones per character cell.** A terminal cell is about twice as tall as it
is wide, so one cell per zone renders a square grid as a stretched
rectangle. Drawing the upper half block with a foreground colour and letting
the background show through the lower half puts two vertically adjacent zones
in one cell, which makes the aspect ratio right and doubles the
effective resolution. A 32x32 frame then fits in 16 terminal rows.

**Confidence is drawn, not printed.** Every zone carries a
signal-to-noise ratio, and a low-confidence reading that looks identical to a
high-confidence one is actively misleading. Colours are mixed toward the
background in proportion to confidence, so uncertain zones recede and
the eye is drawn to the readings worth trusting.

**Multi-object zones are marked.** The part reports up to four objects
per zone, which is genuinely unusual, and a renderer that shows only
the nearest hides it. Cells where the sensor saw through an edge are marked so
that capability is visible rather than described.

Colour is 24-bit ANSI. A monochrome fallback using shaded characters is
provided for terminals or captures that cannot carry colour, and it is what
the application note prints, since a PDF cannot show ANSI colour anyway.
