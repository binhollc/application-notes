"""Run exactly the commands an application note prints, and check them.

The notes in this series share one utility, so a change made for one note can
break another silently. AN0003 added SPI to the shared STM32 tool, which made
--bus a required option, which invalidated every command line printed in
AN0002. Nobody noticed until the archives were rebuilt.

This runs the documented command set against real hardware and checks two
different things, because a plain diff is the wrong instrument here:

  shape      the output, with volatile values masked, must match a saved
             golden. This catches renamed labels, dropped rows, reordered
             sections, changed argument names.

  invariants named regular expressions that must appear. These are the claims
             the note actually makes, so they are checked literally rather
             than through the mask: a chip id that matches, a CCC that is not
             implemented, an interrupt rate close to the configured one.

Masking without invariants would pass a run where every number went wrong.
Invariants without masking would fail on every run, because pressure and
sample counts are not reproducible. Both together are the useful test.

One device is on the target board at a time, so --device is required unless
--list is given. Goldens live in documented/ beside this file.
