"""Exercise the I3C target in a MEMS sensor from a Binho Supernova.

This is not a sensor driver. Vendor drivers exist and are better at that job.
What this does is drive the I3C command surface and establish, from observable
effects, which parts of it a given target actually implements.

That distinction exists because of one measured fact: a target ACKs its
dynamic address and silently discards commands it does not implement, which
the I3C specification permits. So a command completing successfully is not
evidence that the target supports it. Support has to be established by
observing a change: set a value and read it back, move an address and confirm
the old one stops answering, enable an interrupt and count what arrives.

    python i3c_mems.py scan
    python i3c_mems.py identify --device bmp585
    python i3c_mems.py features --device bmp585
    python i3c_mems.py stream   --device bmi323 --seconds 5
    python i3c_mems.py ibi      --device bmi323 --seconds 5
    python i3c_mems.py rates    --device bmp585

Adding a device is one entry in PROFILES. The parts on the I3C Target Board
that are not listed here have not been exercised on hardware, and a profile
written from a datasheet alone would be exactly the guess this tool exists to
avoid.

Requires the binhosupernova package and a Supernova with an I3C interface.
