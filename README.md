# Binho application notes

Technical how-to documents for Binho hardware, with the scripts and assets needed to
reproduce each one.

Every note is published in three places:

| Form | Where |
|---|---|
| PDF | `https://cdn.binho.io/application-notes/<ID>/<ID>.pdf` |
| Assets archive | `https://cdn.binho.io/application-notes/<ID>/<ID>-assets.zip` |
| Source and assets | This repository, one folder per note |

A note at revision 0.x is a draft: it is under internal review and is not published. A
draft may carry a PDF in its folder so it can be read on paper, but that PDF is not the
published artifact, nothing is served from the CDN for it, and no assets archive is built
until it reaches 1.0.

## Repository layout

```
AN0001-<slug>/
  AN0001.md          the note, in Markdown, with front matter
  AN0001.pdf         built PDF (committed so the repo is self-contained)
  AN0001-assets.zip  built archive, the same one served from the CDN
  assets/            scripts and files the note tells the reader to download
  figures/           images referenced from the Markdown
  README.md          short landing page for the folder
_shared/
  legal.md           legal boilerplate, shared by every note
_template/
  scaffold for a new note
```

## Reproducing a note

Each note is self-contained. Download the assets archive, or clone this repository and use
the `assets/` folder directly. Requirements are stated in the note itself.

## Building

The build and publishing tooling lives in Binho's internal content repository, not here.
The Markdown source, figures and assets in this repository are the inputs to it.

## Contributing

These notes describe procedures that were run on real hardware. Corrections are welcome,
particularly reports of behavior that differs on a part or board revision we did not test.
Open an issue with the device, board and firmware versions involved.

## License

Two different terms apply in this repository, so the distinction is worth stating plainly.

- **Example code** — everything under each note's `assets/` directory — is released under the
  MIT license. Each note carries the licence text at `assets/LICENSE`, and a copy travels
  inside its assets archive.
- **The application notes themselves**, meaning the Markdown and PDF documents and their
  figures, are © Binho Inc. They may be read, printed and shared as published; they are not
  MIT licensed.

There is deliberately no repository-level `LICENSE` file. GitHub derives the single licence
label it shows from that file, and a top-level MIT would announce that the documents are MIT
too, which they are not. The licence sits with the code it covers.
